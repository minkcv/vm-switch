# Vapor Spec VM for Nintendo Switch

An implementation of [Vapor Spec](https://github.com/minkcv/vm) for Nintendo Switch Homebrew.

## Building
See the [devkitPro Getting Started page](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

then,

    $ cd vm-switch
    $ make

Should produce an nro and nso for switch homebrew.

You can also use the experimental switch emulator [Ryujinx](https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx) to run this.
But if you're not developing this project, you can just use [Vapor Spec for desktop](https://github.com/minkcv/vm/releases)
